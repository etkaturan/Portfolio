## Tools and Libraries
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Flask, Jinja2
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Docker
- **3D/Graphics:** Three.js, Spline

---

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Complex Animations** – Use pre-built GSAP components to reduce development time.
2. **Deployment Errors** – Use Docker to ensure uniform environments between development and production.
3. **Performance Issues** – Optimize React components and minimize API calls.

---

## Success Metrics
- Fully responsive and interactive portfolio.
- Deployed and accessible live URL.
- User feedback on interactivity and design.
- Smooth operation of contact form and CV download.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AI chatbot using spatial hypertext.
- Add blog or project insights section.
- Create admin dashboard to update portfolio dynamically.

---

**Next Step:** Begin with Flask-React integration and frontend design setup.
